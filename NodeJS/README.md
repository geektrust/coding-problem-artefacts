This document covers following aspects of code evaluation for NodeJS using the NPM execution environment. 

* [Build](#build)
* [Correctness](#correctness)
* [Unit tests](#unit-tests)


Under the NodeJS runtime environment, we execute Javascript and [Typescript](#Typescript) code. 

# Supported Versions

* 12.6.0
* 14.15.4
* 16.10.0

# Build

For NodeJS we support the following dependency/build system as of now

* [NPM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/node-js-npm-node-package-manager/)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)

If you are using `Javascript` then your main file should be named as `geektrust.js`.
## NPM

NPM is the default package manager for NodeJS. NPM can install all the dependencies of a project through the package.json file. It can also update and uninstall packages. In the package.json file, each dependency can specify a range of valid versions using the semantic versioning scheme, allowing developers to auto-update their packages while at the same time avoiding unwanted breaking changes.

A sample `package.json` file can be downloaded from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geektrust/coding-problem-artefacts/master/NodeJS/package.json)

In your `package.json` file make sure you have an entry for the following:

1. Start script which points to the execution of `geektrust.js`
2. Test script to execute all the unit tests present.

```javascript
"scripts": {
    "start": "node geektrust.js",
    "test": "mocha"
}
```

We run the following command to build you solution.

```
npm ci --silent
```

## Yarn

We also support yarn as a build tool if you want to use it. 

Your project should have the `package.json` file which handles all the dependencies. In that file make sure you have an entry for the start script which points to the execution of `geektrust.js` and a test script that executes all the unit tests present.

```javascript
"scripts": {
    "start": "node geektrust.js",
    "test": "mocha"
}
```

We build the solution by using the following command.

```javascript
yarn install --silent
```

# Correctness

We expect your program to take the location to the text file as parameter. Input needs to be read from a text file, and output should be printed to the console. The text file will contain only commands in the format prescribed by the respective problem.

This main file, `geektrust.js` should receive in the command line argument and parse the file passed in. Once the file is parsed and the application processes the commands, it should only print the output.

For e.g your `geektrust.js` file will look like this

```javascript
const filename = process.argv[2];
// parse the file and process the command
// print the output
```

## Execution

### No build

We will execute the program using the command 

```
node geektrust.js <absolute_path_to_input_file>
```

### NPM 

Once the `npm install` from the previous build process is complete, we will execute the program using the command

```javascript
npm start --silent <absolute_path_to_input_file>
```

### Yarn

Once the `yarn install` from the previous build process is complete, we will execute the program using the command

```javascript
yarn run --silent start <absolute_path_to_input_file>
```

# Unit tests

For NodeJS we support the following frameworks for unit testing

* [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)
* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)

For both the frameworks we use [Istanbul](https://istanbul.js.org/) as the code coverage tool.

## Execution

### Mocha

After `npm install` Mocha based test cases are executed with the following command from the root folder

```javascript
mocha test
```
### Jest

After `npm install` Jest based test cases are executed with the following command from the root folder

```javascript
jest
```

# Typescript

**Please note that we DO NOT support TypeScript for Automated Code Evaluation for parameters Object Modeling and Readability. That will be manually reviewd by our team. These instructions are only to get check the correctness and build parameters of the code.** 

## Instructions for checking Correctness/Build

Your main file should be named as `geektrust.ts`.

As of now we only support Typescript under the NPM build system. This will require you to compile your typescript program into javascript. 

We run the commands `npm install --silent`, `npm start --silent` and `npm test --silent`. 

Please ensure that the `npm install` commands creates the file `geektrust.js` from your `geektrust.ts` file. The `npm start` command should then execute this `geektrust.js` file. 

In your `package.json` file make sure you have an entry for the install, start and test script. 

1. The `install` command  should install the dependencies and also build the `geektrust.js` file. 
2. The `start` command will execute the program.
3. The `test` command should execute all the unit tests present

```javascript
"scripts": {
    "install" :"<command to create your geektrust.js file>",
    "start": "node geektrust.js",
    "test": "mocha"
}
```

Note: If you create the `geektrust.js` file in some other folder (like dist/, build/ or out/)other than the main folder, then please appropriately edit the `start` command.
